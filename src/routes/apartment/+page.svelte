  Around the beginning of October 2023, I moved into a cozy 99 square foot SRO
  (Single Room Occupancy) apartment in lower Manhattan. The bathroom is shared
  with the entire floor, and is not included in the 99 square feet. There is a
  mini fridge and no stove in the apartment (but that's fine with me, since I
  <a href="/canned">just use the microwave</a>).
</p>
<p>
  After living in a 2 BR apartment with a roommate for 2 years, I was curious
  about trying out independent living. But the rents in lower Manhattan for a
  studio were quite high, so I began to seriously consider SROs.
</p>
<p>
  Price was not the only factor. I was genuinely curious about the experience of
  living and working from a highly compact space. In theory, it seemed
  efficient. To get anywhere in a small apartment, you just need to walk a few
  steps.
</p>
<p>
  So I took the jump! I've found that the small space forces me to find creative
  ways to optimize the space, and I'm forced to keep things tidy or I'll
  immediately suffer the consequences.
</p>
<p>
  It's definitely an interesting space and building with its fair share of
  quirks, but I like it so far! Sometimes, less is more.
