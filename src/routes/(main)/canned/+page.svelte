	<h1 class="text-center">Canned Food</h1>
	<p>
		I eat a lot of canned foods as part of my normal diet, which is something many people find
		bizarre about me. See below for some pictures of what I normally eat on a daily basis. There are
		some variations here and there based on the availability and cost of ingredients (I also try to
		keep my food costs reasonable without compromising on quality).
	</p>
	<p>
		Please note that not all ingredients shown are canned, but everything is prepared with use of a
		microwave or hot water kettle. I also get some perishables and non-canned ingredients from
		websites or local grocery stores, and I eat some fresh fruits and string cheese throughout the
		day as a snack.
	</p>
	<p>
		Disclaimer: I do not necessarily recommend that you follow what I do, but this diet has worked
		for me so far since I started around January 2022. I think canned ingredients are great for a
		variety of reasons, and I encourage people to use more of them as part of their daily cooking.
